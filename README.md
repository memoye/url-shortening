## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) - React Hooks for Data Fetching
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Strongly typed programming language built on JS

### What I learned

I tried SWR for fetching for the first time. I must say, pretty neat!

### Continued development

I had a really terrible experience with [cleanuri](https://cleanuri.com/docs). I spent so much time trying to make it work.

I was getting a successful `200` status code in the browser `Networks` tab (shown below);

The "Response" tab showed this;

and when I log the response to the console, I get this;

I tried using `fetch` with `useEffect` (no SWR) - no luck, I tried `axios` - nothing!

I didn't want to give up so easily.

This wasted a lot of my time - almost a whole day, simply because I didn't want to admit defeat and just use another API. In the end, that's exactly what I did. I used [Shrtlnk API](https://shrtlnk.dev/developer) instead, and with [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/), I accomplished it in about five minutes.

Going forward, I think I should know when to stop and look for alternatives when something just doesn't work.

Oh, and I think I should start writing tests for my projects too.
